Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
For the house class, I overloaded moveIn() and moveOut(), so you can move roommates in and out together in case they live in a double. For the library class, I overloaded addTitle(), because even though most of the time you can assume that when you are adding a new book it will be avalible, in case it has been added to the system and isn't avalible yet it is possible to specify that. I also made an overload to the constructor allowing you to create a library class with a head librarian, and an accessor to get the name of the head librarian. For the cafe class, I overloaded sellCoffee() so that you can order a black coffee without having to specify "0" for cream and sugar. I also overloaded restock() so you can only refill the beans in the machine. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Testing the methods in main worked really well for me, especially because the concrete examples I had to make for those (as opposed to a more theoretical test) were very easy to repurpose when creating a campus map.
